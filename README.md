# multilevel-model-selection

The `radon` data includes readings from 919 homes within 85 distinct counties across the state of Minnesota. Radon is a dangerous gas that can cause severe health problems. To limit radon exposure, state health departments conduct routine readings at homes across their jurisdictions. However, due to limited resources, it is impossible to monitor every home in the state.

I a multilevel model to identify which counties should be prioritized for inspection.
